  <p>
    A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product. These activities may involve the development of software from scratch
    in a standard programming language like Java or C. However, business applications
    are not necessarily developed in this way. New business software is now often developed by extending and modifying existing systems or by configuring and integrating
    off-the-shelf software or system components.
  </p>

  <p>There are many different software processes but all must include four activities
    that are fundamental to software engineering:</p>

  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
    <li><strong>Software specification</strong> – The functionality of the software and constraints on its
      operation must be defined.</li>
    <li><strong>Software design and implementation</strong> – The software to meet the specification
      must be produced.</li>
    <li><strong>Software validation</strong> – The software must be validated to ensure that it does what
      the customer wants.</li>
    <li><strong>Software evolution</strong> – The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.</li>
  </ol>
</article>

<article class="mb-10 space-y-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
  <p>
    In some form, these activities are part of all software processes. In practice, of
    course, they are complex activities in themselves and include sub-activities such as
    requirements validation, architectural design, unit testing, etc. There are also supporting process activities such as documentation and software configuration management.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we describe and discuss processes, we usually talk about the activities in
    these processes such as specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc., and
    the ordering of these activities. However, as well as activities, process descriptions
    may also include:
  </p>

  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
    <li><strong>Products</strong> – the outcomes of a process activity. For example, the outcome of architectural design may be a model of the software architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>Roles</strong> – responsibilities of the people involved in the process (e.g., project manager, programmer).</li>
    <li><strong>Pre- and post-conditions</strong> – statements that are true before and after a
        process activity has been enacted. For example, before architectural design begins,
        all requirements must be approved; afterward, UML models may be reviewed.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Software processes are complex and, like all intellectual and creative processes,
    rely on people making decisions and judgments. There is no ideal process and most
    organizations have developed their own software development processes. Processes
    have evolved to take advantage of the people in an organization and the systems being developed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes, software processes are categorized as either <strong>plan-driven</strong> or <strong>agile</strong>.
    Plan-driven processes are fully planned in advance, while agile processes are incremental
    and adapt to changing customer requirements. Each approach suits different contexts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although there is no ‘ideal’ software process, there is scope for improving processes
    in many organizations. Some may include outdated techniques, while others don’t
    use the best practices in industrial software engineering.
  </p>

  <p>
    Software processes can be improved by <strong>process standardization</strong>, which reduces diversity across an organization, improves communication, reduces training time,
    and makes automated support more economical. It also prepares organizations to adopt
    new engineering practices. (Process improvement is discussed in Chapter 26.)
